### About!

I'm Ryuichiro Hataya, a PhD student at UTokyo, RA at RIKEN AIP, and RA at RIISE@UTokyo. 

I am interested in Deep Learning from limited labeled data.

### News

* My research proposals are accepted by MSRA, and RIISE at UTokyo!
* Our paper “Decomposing Normal and Abnormal Features of Medical Images for Content-based Image Retrieval” is accepted at ML4H 2020.
* We will host a virtual NeurIPS meetup in Japan https://neuripsmeetupjapan.github.io!
* Our research “MADAO: Meta Approach to Data Augmentation Optimization” won Best Student Paper Award at MIRU 2020. This is a preliminary work of [Meta Approach to Data Augmentation Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07965).
* Our paper [Faster AutoAugment: Learning Augmentation Strategies using Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06987) is accepted at ECCV 2020. Code is also [available](https://github.com/moskomule/dda/tree/fasteraa/faster_autoaugment).
